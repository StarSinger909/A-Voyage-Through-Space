		<h1>The Search For Life</h1>
		<p>There’s one question that has been nagging scientists for centuries: is there life beyond us? And there is. Somewhere.</p>
		<p>According to NASA,”The search for life beyond Earth is really just getting started, but science has an encouraging early answer: there are plenty of planets in the galaxy, many with similarities to our own. But what we don’t know fills volumes.”
Basically, yes, it is almost confirmed that there is life beyond us. The universe is HUGE, and there may even be a multiverse (more on that later).</p>
		<h1>How Will We Find Life?</h1>
		<p>We don't really have a universally accepted definition of life itself. That said, we might not need one. We need only detect the telltale signs of life in an exoplanet (a planet outside our solar system) atmosphere , and we have a better understanding of what those look like here on Earth. (nasa.gov)
As reported by NASA,”The James Webb Space Telescope , launched in 2021, could get the first glimpses: the mix of gasses in the atmospheres of Earth-sized exoplanets. Webb, or a similar spacecraft in the future, could pick up signs of an atmosphere like our own - oxygen, carbon dioxide, methane. A strong indication of possible life. Future telescopes might even pick up signs of photosynthesis – the transformation of light into chemical energy by plants – or even gasses or molecules suggesting the presence of animal life. Intelligent, technological life might create atmospheric pollution, as it does on our planet, also detectable from afar. Of course, the best we might be able to manage is an estimate of probability. Still, an exoplanet with, say, a 95 percent probability of life would be a game changer of historic proportions.”.</p>
	<h2>Methods</h2>
	<p>When we go to exoplanets, the light spread into rainbows will provide a better understanding of what it’s like on the planet. Rainbows have different colors because of the elements in our Earth. And, rainbows is just light split into a spectrum. Colors represent chemicals and gases. So, if we can see rainbows on exoplanets, it’ll show what kinds of elements, chemicals, and gases are in the atmosphere, in turn showing if it can support life or not.<br>One of the best tools scientists have for narrowing  the search for habitable worlds is a concept known as “habitable zone “, or the Goldilocks zone. The definition of the habitable zone is the distance from a star at  which liquid water could exist around orbiting planets’ surfaces. It’s not to cold, not to hot. Of course, it really depends on the star.  Most planets around the size of the Earth orbits around red-dwarfs, and it’s most likely that habitable planets are rocky, not gaseous or icy. Water is CRUCIAL for life, and as far as we know, nothing can survive without liquid water.
